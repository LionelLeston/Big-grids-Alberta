#There are date, time, weater, observer,
#and method descriptor variables in the raw data that will affect the number of
#birds counted in a given recording. Most recordings are for 3 minutes but 
#there are 10-minute recordings and a few 1-minute recordings. Most points in
#a grid are ~600 m apart but they are 1 km apart in grid 1.

#What happened is that some visits were listened to 2 or more times using different
#survey protocols (e.g. visit length). All visits were listened to for at least 3 minutes.
#But some visits were listened to again for just the first minute or additional birds
#were listened for over 7 additional minutes. This was probably done to see if certain species
#were missed or if a 1-minute recording could be used instead of 3 minutes and gain the
#same number of individuals or species, or if a 10-minute recording resulted in significantly
#more individuals and species being detected. If the 1-minute and 10-minute survey protocols are filtered
#out then nearly all stations and visits will still have a 3-minute recording.

#However, nearly all stations on Big Grids 2,3,and 4 only had a 3+7 minute recording transcribed.
